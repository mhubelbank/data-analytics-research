This contains selected excerpts of the Python data analysis and visualization I conducted as an undergraduate research assistant for the Northeastern University Sociology department. My work for the Fall 2020 term culminates in an exhaustive analysis report on the project's data corpus; this is a multi-part, markdown-documented Jupyter Notebook file linked [here](https://github.com/mhubelbank/data-science-research/blob/main/master%20data%20analysis%20project/src/master_src.ipynb). For this task, I perform thorough dataset preprocessing, exploratory and descriptive analysis, error and anomaly detection, visualization, and summary. 

There are two folders with visualizations I produced earlier on in the project, one of which is used in a published report on the research team's findings.

Data sources and inputs have been excluded for the purpose of preserving the team's proprietary research and development.
